# MIR-Project
Modern Information Retrieval Project 
Phase1:
  Data preprocessing, Create Positional Index and Bigram Index, Compression with Gamma Code and Variable Byte Code, Decode and Load index, Query Correction.
Phase2:
  Language Model, Smoothing by Interpolation, Edit Probability Model, Uniform-Cost Edit Model, Candidate Generator, Candidate Scorer with Weighting, Improved Edit Probability Model.
Phase3:
  Use tf-idf Algorithm and SVD Parsing to Create Embedding Data, Classification with Naïve Bayes، k-Nearest Neighbors and SVM, Model evaluation with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, Clusternig with k-means and Agglomerative Clustering, Crawler Implementation  and Evaluate Articles with PageRank Algorithm.
